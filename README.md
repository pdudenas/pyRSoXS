# pyRSoXS
Prototype Python implementation of a Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering Simulator with support for full biaxial dielectric tensors. Calculations are performed on GPU using a combination of cupy and Numba CUDA kernels.

For the uniaxial C++/CUDA implementation, see https://github.com/usnistgov/cyrsoxs
